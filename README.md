This e-commerce web application features a streamlined two-page design: the Home Page and the Cart Page. The Home Page displays a variety of products in a responsive grid, each with an image, name, description, and price, alongside an "Add to Cart" button. Users can easily browse products and add them to their cart. The Cart Page provides a detailed summary of selected items, including images, names, descriptions, quantities, and prices. Users can adjust quantities or remove items, and a summary section on the right shows the total number of items, total price, and final amount, with checkout options available. On mobile devices, the cart summary is positioned below the cart items for enhanced usability.
